            <h2>The Queen from Arue</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Facing the ocean waves with her head supporting her long, arched arms, her beautifully rich brown skin mesmerizes every one who takes a glimpse of the picture. Her pose exudes so much grace, confidence and calmness that she has to be proud. Yes, I said proud.</p>
            <br>
            <p>She has to be proud of the beauty she possesses, because it does not stop at what the eyes see, but her mind is a well of ideas, constantly erupting into waves of productivity and ingenuity. She has a heart of gold, caring for those around her and always ensuring thier well being.</p>
            <br>
            <p>She has to be proud of her graceful and confident strides everytime she takes a step. She walks like a model on a runway, with those beautiful long legs leading her purposefully. Her confidence gives the sense that she knows what she wants and will stop at nothing to achieve her goals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>She has to be proud of her achievments because she has always faced every storm with the calming thought that the one who crafted her with such finesse and perfection will definitely see her through till the rainbow appears.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So what do you get when you combine beauty, grace, confidence, wisdom and calmness in one person and then give the person a name that means "<i>a child is greater than wealth</i>"?</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Queen from Arue.</p>
